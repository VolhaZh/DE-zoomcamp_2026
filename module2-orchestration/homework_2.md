6) How would you configure the timezone to New York in a Schedule trigger?
- Add a `timezone` property set to `EST` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration  
- Add a `timezone` property set to `America/New_York` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration
- Add a `timezone` property set to `UTC-5` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration
- Add a `location` property set to `New_York` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration  

### Answer: - Add a `timezone` property set to `America/New_York` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration

### Solution: example Configuration:
```Python
# Airflow
with DAG(
    dag_id="taxi_pipeline",
    schedule="0 9 * * *",  
    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2024, 1, 1, tz="America/New_York"),  
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
```

```yaml
# Kestra
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "0 9 * * *"
    timezone: "America/New_York"
    inputs:
      taxi: yellow
```
